# Copy-That

This repo was made for my MIT Maker Portfolio. I didn't actually use Github while making this game - it was made directly on Roblox studio (which already has a good collaboration and version control system).

Also, this repo doesn't contain every single asset used in Copy That. This repo only contains the code in the game - the UI elements, 3D assets, folders, and etc... are not contained within this repo.
